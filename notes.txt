create virtual environment: python -m venv .venv
Activate virtual environment: .venv\scripts\activate
How to activate .env file: pip install python-dotenv then from dotenv import load_dotenv then add this function load_dotenv()  # Load variables from .env into the environment
Run the requirement.txt file: pip install -r requirements.txt
create requirement.txt file: pip freeze > requirements.txt
to run the program : streamlit run main.py

GIT PUSH Steps: 
In the terminal, initialize a new Git repository: git init
Add all files in your folder to the staging area: git add .
Commit the files with a message: git commit -m "Initial commit"
Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you mentioned: git remote add origin https://github.com/tosurajitc/Agentic_Reporting.git
Push the changes to the remote repository: git push -u origin master

Project Structure: To run the program from bash: python main.py --ui

======================================================================================================
Web Agent
The web agent is responsible for:

Connecting to the DGFT portal
Navigating through different sections (Notifications, Public Notices, Circulars)
Extracting document metadata including dates, descriptions, and attachment links
Downloading PDF attachments

The agent uses Selenium for web automation and handles various error conditions.
PDF Agent
The PDF agent processes and analyzes PDF documents:

Extracts text using PyPDF2 for text-based PDFs
Falls back to OCR using Tesseract for image-based PDFs
Analyzes content using GROQ LLM to generate summaries
Handles file conversions and text processing

Email Agent
The email agent sends notifications:

Composes formatted HTML emails with document details
Attaches PDF files
Sends emails via SMTP
Handles authentication and error conditions

Query Agent
The query agent interprets natural language queries:

Processes user queries using GROQ LLM or rule-based fallbacks
Extracts search parameters (document type, date range, keywords)
Filters documents based on query parameters
Returns matching documents ranked by relevance

Data Handler
The data handler manages document data:

Stores and retrieves document metadata
Manages processed documents with OCR text and analysis
Persists data to disk for durability
Provides document search and filtering

Configuration System
The configuration system:

Loads environment variables from .env file
Validates configuration values
Provides configuration status and error reporting
Makes configuration available to all components

Additional Features
Command-Line Interface
The system includes a comprehensive CLI for automation and integration with other systems:

Fetch updates via scheduled jobs
Process documents in batch mode
Send automated notifications
Run queries programmatically

Error Handling and Logging
The system includes robust error handling and logging:

Detailed logging of all operations
Fallbacks for API failures
Graceful degradation when components are unavailable

Data Persistence
The system persists data to ensure durability:

Saves document metadata to JSON files
Stores processed documents with OCR text and analysis
Maintains state between runs

Future Enhancements
Potential enhancements for the system include:

Multi-user support - Add authentication and user-specific preferences
Additional document sources - Extend to monitor other regulatory websites
Advanced analytics - Track changes in regulations over time
Document comparison - Highlight differences between versions
Automated tagging - Use AI to categorize documents by topic
Mobile notifications - Add push notifications via mobile app
Improved OCR - Enhance OCR with custom models for regulatory documents
API integration - Provide REST API for integrating with other systems

Troubleshooting
Common Issues

Web scraping failures

Check if the DGFT website structure has changed
Update the web agent selectors if needed
Try increasing wait times for slow connections


OCR issues

Verify Tesseract is properly installed
Check OCR language settings
Increase DPI for better text recognition


Email sending failures

Verify SMTP settings
Check if app password is correct
Ensure less secure app access is enabled for the sender account


GROQ API errors

Verify API key is valid
Check for usage limits
Ensure model name is correct



For any other issues, check the application logs in app.log for detailed error messages.
